*   The Action Cable server is now mounted with `anchor: true`.

    This means that routes that also start with `/cable` will no longer clash with Action Cable.

    *Alex Ghiculescu*

*   `ActionCable.server.remote_connections.where(...).disconnect` now sends `disconnect` message
    before closing the connection with the reconnection strategy specified (defaults to `true`).

    *Vladimir Dementyev*

*   Added command callbacks to `ActionCable::Base::Connection`.

    Now you can define `before_command`, `after_command`, and `around_command` to be invoked before, after or around any command received by a client respectively.
